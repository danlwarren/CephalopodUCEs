# CephalopodUCEs

## Data

We conducted UCE bait design using Phyluce version 1.6.6 (Faircloth 2016; Faircloth et al. 2012), following standard procedures given in that package for UCE identification and bait design.  The genomes used for bait design were *Loligo pealei* (now *Doryteuthis pealei*, Titus Brown, unpublished data http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-loligo-transcriptome-data.html), *Octopus vulgaris* (Zarrella et al. 2019), *Octopus bimaculoides* (Albertin et al. 2015), and *Octopus minor* (Kim et al. 2018).  We also tested baits in silico against the genome of the golden apple snail, *Pomacea canaliculata* (Liu et al. 2018) to assess their ability to amplify UCEs in non-cephalopod molluscs.
